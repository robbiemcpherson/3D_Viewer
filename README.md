# 3D_Viewer

Use the functions in shapes.py or add your own to shapes.py to choose what gets displayed

if you create your own function, make sure to use this format for the coordinates that the function returns:
  [[x, y, z], [x, y, z], [x, y, z], ...]

to select a shape set the COORDINATES variable in the main function of CoordinatesTo3D.py to the desired function

pay attention to function parameters and be mindful of the number of points that will be generated, the program can usually 
run smoothly for up to 500 points

global variables are initialized in global.py, so adjust these values to suit your needs
